Create a complete, production-quality Laravel eCommerce web application that runs on Replit. The app must include a public frontend and an admin panel. Everything on the frontend (hero banners/video, main menu, submenus, all homepage sections, categories, product groupings, featured/special offers, order tracker link, etc.) must be fully controllable from the admin panel. Categories created in admin (main → sub → child) must be automatically reflected in the frontend menu. Customers must be able to register/login, place orders, view order history and track order status. The site’s frontend should be modern, responsive and ‘trending’ (clean layout, big hero, micro-animations, mobile-first).

Required tech stack & packages

Backend: Laravel (latest stable)

Frontend: Blade + Tailwind CSS for UI (or optional Vue/Alpine for richer interactions)

Admin UI: Filament Admin (or custom admin with Tailwind + Livewire) — admin must be powerful, not static.

DB: MySQL / MariaDB (Replit provides a database option; alternatively SQLite for quick dev)

Auth: Laravel Breeze or Jetstream (use Breeze for simplicity and Blade compatibility)

Order tracking: Order model + tracking statuses and public order tracking page (search by order id & email)

Media / files: Use local storage for Replit; design storage abstraction for S3 later.

Search & filters: Database search with full-text where possible, category filters, price filter, sort by popularity/new/price.

Payment: Provide payment gateway integration stubs (Stripe sandbox) and offline COD.

Replit specifics: Provide composer.json, .replit (run command), replit.nix or instructions to enable PHP 8+ & composer, and .env.example. Provide a simple start script.

Deliverables (must produce)

Full Laravel project structure with working routes, controllers, models, views, migrations, seeders, factories, middleware, and tests for key flows.

Admin panel with CRUD for:

Products (images, gallery, SKU, price, sale price, stock, weight, dimensions, attributes)

Categories (Main → Sub → Child hierarchy)

Brands

Banners/hero blocks (static image or video URL) — reorderable

Home page sections (add/remove/reorder editable content blocks; WYSIWYG or structured block types)

Coupons and special offers

Orders and statuses + shipment tracking fields

Users & roles (Admin, Manager, Customer support)

Settings (site name, contact, currency, tax settings, payment credentials)

Frontend:

Fully dynamic main menu showing categories in three levels exactly as created in admin.

Hero area (image/video) controlled by admin (enable/disable video or image, autoplay option).

Admin features — details

Menu & Categories manager:

Create hierarchy: main → sub → child.

Drag-and-drop ordering.

Toggle visibility. Frontend menu reads only visible categories.

Hero manager:

Upload hero image or paste video URL (YouTube/Vimeo or mp4).

Option: show video (autoplay, mute), otherwise show image.

CTA text & link editable.

Home blocks:

Add block types: Featured products (select product list), Category products (pick category; sort order), Promo HTML (rich text), Banner carousel (choose banners), Custom code (HTML) — admin can place blocks and reorder.

Product manager:

CSV import/export for bulk upload.

Set attributes & variants, stock per variant.

Mark product as featured/special/trending.

Schedule sale prices (start/stop date).

Order manager:

View/update statuses (Pending → Processing → Shipped → Delivered → Cancelled).

Add tracking number and update tracking status; send email notification on update.

Role-based access: Admin and Manager roles with permissions.

Frontend behavior specifics

Menu: top nav shows Main Categories (level 1). On hover (desktop) or tap (mobile) show submenus and child categories. Only categories with is_active appear.

Order Tracker: main menu shows “Track Order” link/icon. Clicking opens a modal or page where user enters Order ID & email to fetch order status and tracking updates.

Homepage admin blocks: Admin chooses order and content of home blocks — frontend reads home_blocks ordered by position and renders accordingly.

Product listing rules:

Special Offer: products with active sale_price and within sale dates

Featured Product: is_featured == true

Product by Category: listing filtered by selected category and includes products in its child categories.

Cart persistence: for logged-in users sync cart server side; for guests use session/cookie.

SEO: proper meta tags per product/category, sitemaps, and friendly slugs.

Accessibility: keyboard nav, alt tags, ARIA for critical UI.

Security & validation

Server-side validation for all forms.

CSRF protection enabled.

Password hashing and login throttling.

Input sanitization for admin custom HTML (sanitize or provide safe WYSIWYG).

Role-based guard for admin panel routes (middleware).

Replit setup & start commands (deliverable)

Include:

.replit with start command: composer install && php artisan migrate --seed && php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000

replit.nix or instructions to enable PHP & composer on Replit (provide both options).

.env.example with placeholders for DB, mail, stripe, app url.

Guide to set environment variables from Replit UI and setting up a persistent file storage (if any).

A short checklist in README for Replit-specific config and common gotchas.

UX / Design brief (for “trending” frontend)

Modern hero with large san-serif font, centered CTA button, autoplay muted video fallback to hero image.

Use Tailwind utility classes for rapid responsive layout.

Prominent search bar in navbar with suggestion dropdown and category filter.

Cart & user icon in nav; order tracker button visible.

Product cards with quick-add hover action, rating badges, and “sale” tagging.

Smooth micro-animations (fade/slide) using CSS or small Alpine/Vue for interactions.

Mobile-first: collapsible menu with full category tree.
